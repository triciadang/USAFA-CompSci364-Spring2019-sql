SQL
===

This programming exercise (PEX) provides practice with the Structured Query
Language (SQL), partly in preparation for the SQL in-class assessment.

Instructions
============

Load the ``Ch07_ConstructCo.sql`` and ``Ch07_LargeCo.sql`` files to populate
the data for this assignment.

Modify the file in the ``src`` directory that corresponds to the question. You
do *not* need to delete the SQL comment that appears at the beginning of the
file -- it is included as a convenience when writing the query.

`Travis CI`_ will test all the queries. If the results from executing your
query matches the expected results, then your query is likely to be correct,
the exception being the non-SELECT queries. You should not modify any files in
the test directory; doing so could prevent the automated tests from running
correctly. Please also note that the entire class must share the resources
provided by Travis so there may be a significant delay before running the
tests. You should test each query against a local copy of the database before
pushing it to GitHub.
